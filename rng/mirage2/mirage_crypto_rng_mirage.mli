val initialize :
  ?g:'a -> ?sleep:int64 -> 'a Mirage_crypto_rng.generator -> unit Lwt.t
(** [initialize ~g ~sleep generator] sets the default generator to the
    [generator] and sets up periodic entropy feeding for that rng. This
    function fails ([Lwt.fail]) if it is called a second time. The argument
    [~sleep] is measured in ns, and used as sleep between cpu assisted random
    number collection. It defaults to one second. *)
