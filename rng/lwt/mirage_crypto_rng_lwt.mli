(** {b RNG} seeding on {b Lwt}.

    This module initializes a Fortuna RNG with [getrandom()], and CPU RNG.
*)

(** [initialize ~g ~sleep generator] will bring the RNG into a working state.
    The argument [sleep] is measured in ns (default 1s), and used to sleep
    between collection of entropy from the CPU RNG, every [10 * sleep] getrandom
    is used to collect entropy.
